This project covers the entire DevOps lifecycle, employing cutting-edge technologies to automate deployment, scaling, monitoring, and management of applications within Kubernetes clusters hosted on AWS


Kubernetes (K8s)
Description: Kubernetes is an open-source container orchestration platform that automates the deployment, scaling, and management of containerized applications. It provides a platform for automating deployment, scaling, and operations of application containers across clusters of hosts.

Helm
Description: Helm is a package manager for Kubernetes that helps you define, install, and upgrade even the most complex Kubernetes applications. Helm charts are used to define, install, and upgrade Kubernetes applications.

Ingress Controller (NGINX Ingress)
Description: Ingress controllers manage external access to the services in a Kubernetes cluster, typically HTTP/HTTPS. NGINX Ingress is one of the most popular ingress controllers, which configures the NGINX reverse proxy to route incoming traffic to Kubernetes services.

Cert-manager
Description: Cert-manager is a Kubernetes add-on that automates the management and issuance of TLS certificates from various issuing sources, such as Let's Encrypt, for Kubernetes clusters.

Grafana
Description: Grafana is an open-source platform for monitoring and observability. It allows you to query, visualize, alert on, and understand your metrics no matter where they are stored.

Fluentd
Description: Fluentd is an open-source data collector that unifies data collection and consumption. It allows you to unify data collection and consumption for a better understanding of data flow in your system.

Prometheus
Description: Prometheus is an open-source monitoring and alerting toolkit originally built at SoundCloud. It is a powerful tool for monitoring and alerting on time-series metrics collected from various sources, including Kubernetes.

AWS (Amazon Web Services)
Description: AWS is a comprehensive, evolving cloud computing platform provided by Amazon. It offers a suite of cloud services that include computing power, storage options, and networking capabilities to help organizations scale and grow.

EBS (Elastic Block Store)
Description: Amazon Elastic Block Store (EBS) provides block-level storage volumes for use with Amazon EC2 instances. EBS volumes are highly available and reliable storage volumes that can be attached to a running EC2 instance.

CloudWatch
Description: Amazon CloudWatch is a monitoring and observability service that provides you with data and actionable insights to monitor your applications, respond to system-wide performance changes, optimize resource utilization, and get a unified view of operational health.

ALB (Application Load Balancer)
Description: An Application Load Balancer (ALB) distributes incoming application traffic across multiple targets, such as EC2 instances, in multiple availability zones. It operates at the application layer, which allows it to route traffic based on more complex rules than the Network Load Balancer.

AWS ACM (Amazon Certificate Manager)
Description: AWS Certificate Manager (ACM) is a service that lets you easily provision, manage, and deploy public and private SSL/TLS certificates for use with AWS services and your internal connected resources.
